# Variables:

**Variable is a place or a box to store data.** </br>
**Data can be of different types**

- Numbers
- Strings
- True or false
- image

**We have to give a name to variable to create/define it.**

```Java
myName = “Hello”;
myAge = 33;
avgMark = 75.8;

```

## Variable Naming Conventions:

While you name or create a variable it's important to follow certain naming conventions to make your code readable and maintainable:

- Variable names should be descriptive and indicate the purpose of the variable.
- They must start with a letter, underscore (`_`), or dollar sign (`$`). They cannot start with a digit.
- They can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
- Java is case-sensitive, so `count` and `Count` are different variables.
- By convention, variable names are usually written in `camelCase`, where the first word is in lowercase, and subsequent words start with an uppercase letter (e.g., `firstName`, `totalAmount`).
- Avoid using Java keywords (reserved words like `class`, `public`, `int`, etc.) as variable names.
