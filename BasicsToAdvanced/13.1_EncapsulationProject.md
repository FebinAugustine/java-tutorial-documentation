# Encapsulation Project

## Industry Example: BankAccount

Let's consider a BankAccount class in a banking application.

### Scenario WITHOUT Encapsulation (Bad Practice):

If we don't use encapsulation, other parts of the code could directly manipulate the account balance, leading to serious issues.

```Java

// BAD PRACTICE: No encapsulation
public class BadBankAccount {
    public String accountNumber; // Public field - anyone can change this directly
    public double balance;       // Public field - anyone can change this directly

    public BadBankAccount(String accountNumber, double initialBalance) {
        this.accountNumber = accountNumber;
        this.balance = initialBalance;
    }
}

// Somewhere in the application code...
public class FinancialOperation {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BadBankAccount myAccount = new BadBankAccount("123456789", 1000.00);

        System.out.println("Initial Balance: " + myAccount.balance); // Direct read

        // Major Problem 1: Anyone can directly change the balance without any checks!
        myAccount.balance = -500.00; // Oops! Account is now negative without a proper withdrawal
        System.out.println("Balance after direct negative assignment: " + myAccount.balance);

        // Major Problem 2: Could lead to incorrect transactions
        myAccount.balance += 2000.00; // Direct deposit, but what if there's a transaction fee?
                                      // Or if we need to log this transaction?
        System.out.println("Balance after direct deposit: " + myAccount.balance);
    }
}
```

## Problems with the non-encapsulated approach:

### Data Corruption:

The balance can be set to an invalid state (e.g., negative balance without proper overdraft handling).

### No Business Rules:

No way to enforce rules like minimum balance, transaction fees, or limits on withdrawals.

### No Logging/Auditing:

Transactions aren't logged, which is critical in finance.

### Maintenance Nightmare:

If the internal representation of the balance changes (e.g., from double to BigDecimal for precision), every piece of code that directly accesses balance would need to be updated.

### Security Risk:

Direct access could open doors for malicious manipulation.

## Scenario WITH Encapsulation (Good Practice):

Now, let's apply encapsulation to the BankAccount class.

```Java

public class BankAccount {
    // 1. Private Fields (Data Hiding)
    private String accountNumber;
    private double balance; // Use double for simplicity, BigDecimal for production finance

    // Constructor
    public BankAccount(String accountNumber, double initialBalance) {
        // Enforce initial balance rule during creation
        if (initialBalance < 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Initial balance cannot be negative.");
        }
        this.accountNumber = accountNumber;
        this.balance = initialBalance;
        System.out.println("Account " + accountNumber + " created with balance: " + balance);
    }

    // 2. Public Getters (Controlled Read Access)
    public String getAccountNumber() {
        return accountNumber; // Account number can be read
    }

    public double getBalance() {
        return balance; // Balance can be read
    }

    // 3. Public Methods for State Modification (Controlled Write Access with Business Logic)

    // Method to deposit money
    public void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount <= 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Deposit amount must be positive.");
        }
        this.balance += amount;
        // In a real system, you'd also log this transaction, update a database, etc.
        System.out.println("Deposited " + amount + ". New balance: " + this.balance);
    }

    // Method to withdraw money
    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        if (amount <= 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Withdrawal amount must be positive.");
        }
        if (this.balance < amount) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Insufficient funds. Available: " + this.balance);
        }
        this.balance -= amount;
        // In a real system, you'd also log this transaction, update a database, etc.
        System.out.println("Withdrew " + amount + ". New balance: " + this.balance);
    }

    // Example of another business method
    public void applyInterest(double rate) {
        if (rate < 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Interest rate cannot be negative.");
        }
        this.balance += this.balance * rate;
        System.out.println("Interest applied. New balance: " + this.balance);
    }
}

// Somewhere in the application code...
public class SecureFinancialOperation {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            BankAccount myAccount = new BankAccount("987654321", 500.00);

            // Accessing data using getter methods
            System.out.println("Initial Balance via getter: " + myAccount.getBalance());

            // Modifying balance using controlled methods
            myAccount.deposit(250.00);      // Valid deposit
            myAccount.withdraw(100.00);     // Valid withdrawal

            // Attempting invalid operations (will throw exceptions)
            // myAccount.withdraw(1000.00); // Throws IllegalArgumentException: Insufficient funds
            // myAccount.deposit(-50.00);   // Throws IllegalArgumentException: Deposit amount must be positive.
            // myAccount.balance = -100;    // COMPILE-TIME ERROR: 'balance' has private access

            myAccount.applyInterest(0.01); // Apply 1% interest

            System.out.println("Final Balance: " + myAccount.getBalance());

        } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
            System.err.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

### Output:

- Account 987654321 created with balance: 500.0
- Initial Balance via getter: 500.0
- Deposited 250.0. New balance: 750.0
- Withdrew 100.0. New balance: 650.0
- Interest applied. New balance: 656.5
- Final Balance: 656.5

## Benefits of Encapsulation in Industry:

### Data Integrity and Validation:

Critical internal state (like balance) can only be modified through methods that contain validation logic and business rules, preventing invalid states.

### Controlled Access:

You decide exactly how the outside world can interact with your object's data (read-only, write-only, read-write, or via complex operations).

### Maintainability and Flexibility:

If the internal implementation of balance changes (e.g., switching from double to BigDecimal for precision), only the deposit and withdraw methods (and getBalance/setBalance if they existed) need to be updated. The client code that calls deposit or withdraw remains unchanged.

### Security:

Reduces the attack surface by preventing direct manipulation of sensitive data.

### Testability:

Because components are self-contained and interact via well-defined interfaces, they are easier to unit test in isolation.

### Simplicity for Users (Abstraction):

Users of the BankAccount class don't need to know how deposits or withdrawals are handled internally; they just need to know that they can call deposit() or withdraw().

#### In enterprise applications, encapsulation is fundamental for building robust, scalable, and maintainable systems that correctly handle complex business logic and sensitive data.
