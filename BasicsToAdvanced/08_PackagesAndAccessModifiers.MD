# Packages

#### Packages are folders.

#### We can put multiple folders and files in a single folder.

#### To get the access to other files in our current fule use “import” to call it.

## Access Modifiers

As the name suggests this defines the accessibility of the variable, methods in a class for other classes.

### public :

It can be accessed from anywhere

### private :

The variables or methods defined as private can only be accessed from within the same class.

### default :

It can be accessed from with in a package. It is the default access if you you don’t mention any modifiers specifically.

### Protected :

cannot acces from out side the package, but it can be accessed if that is a sub-class.

### Note :

- Best practice One class in one file
- Make the instance variables private.
- Make the methods public.
- Try not to use default.
