# Anonymous Classes in Java

An anonymous class in Java is a local class without a name. It is declared and instantiated (created as an object) in a single expression, typically when you need to provide a very specific, one-time implementation of an interface or an abstract/concrete class. <br> <br>

Think of it as a small, throwaway class that you define and use immediately, and you don't need to reuse its definition anywhere else in your code.

## Key Characteristics of Anonymous Classes:

### No Name:

As the name suggests, they don't have a class name.

### Single Instantiation:

They are declared and instantiated at the same point in the code. You cannot create multiple instances of the same anonymous class, nor can you refer to it by name.

### Local Scope:

They are defined within a method or block of code, and their scope is limited to that block.

### No Constructors:

Since they don't have a name, they cannot have explicit constructors.

### Can Implement an Interface or Extend a Class:

They can implement exactly one interface.
They can extend exactly one abstract class or concrete class.

### Access to Enclosing Scope:

They can access final or "effectively final" local variables of the enclosing scope. (A variable is "effectively final" if its value is never changed after it's initialized).

### Often Replaced by Lambda Expressions:

With Java 8 and later, anonymous classes are often (but not always) replaced by more concise lambda expressions, especially when implementing functional interfaces (interfaces with a single abstract method).

## Purpose of Anonymous Classes in Java:

The primary purpose of anonymous classes is to provide a quick, inline implementation for interfaces or abstract/concrete classes for a single, specific use case. <br>

Common scenarios where anonymous classes are (or were, before lambdas) widely used include:

#### Event Handling / Callbacks:

This is perhaps the most classic use case. When dealing with GUI events (like button clicks in Swing/JavaFX) or asynchronous operations, you often need to provide a small piece of code to execute when an event occurs. An anonymous class is perfect for this one-time implementation of an event listener interface.

#### Example:

Implementing ActionListener for a button, Runnable for a thread, or Comparator for custom sorting.

#### Short, Specific Implementations:

When you need a custom behavior for an interface or abstract class for a very particular situation, and creating a separate, named class would be overkill and reduce readability.

#### Reducing Boilerplate Code (Historically):

Before Java 8 lambdas, anonymous classes were the primary way to achieve this kind of inline behavior, reducing the need for separate .java files for small utility classes.

```Java

public class SimpleAnonymousGreeterExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        System.out.println("Program started.");

        // 2. Create an instance of the Greeter interface using an anonymous class
        // This means we are creating an object that fulfills the Greeter contract
        // right here, without giving this specific implementation a name.
        Greeter englishGreeter = new Greeter() {
            @Override // We must implement the greet() method from the Greeter interface
            public void greet() {
                System.out.println("Hello from an anonymous class!");
            }

            // This is a NEW method added to this anonymous class
            private void printSecretMessage() {
                System.out.println("This is a secret message from a new method within the anonymous class.");
            }
        };

        // 3. Call the greet method on our anonymous object
        englishGreeter.greet(); // This will print: "Hello from an anonymous class!"


        // You could even do it in one line if you just want to call the method immediately:
        new Greeter() {
            @Override
            public void greet() {
                System.out.println("Greetings from another anonymous class!");
            }
        }.greet(); // Call greet() right after creating the anonymous object

        System.out.println("Program finished.");
    }
}

```

#### Example: Implementing Runnable with an Anonymous Class

A Runnable is a functional interface used to define a task that can be executed by a thread.

```Java

public class AnonymousClassPurpose {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        System.out.println("Main thread started.");

        // Using an anonymous class to implement the Runnable interface
        Runnable myTask = new Runnable() {
            // This is the implementation of the single abstract method 'run()' from Runnable
            @Override
            public void run() {
                System.out.println("Anonymous class: Task running in a new thread.");
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(1000); // Simulate some work
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    System.err.println("Thread interrupted!");
                }
                System.out.println("Anonymous class: Task finished.");
            }
        };

        // Create a new Thread and pass the anonymous Runnable implementation
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(myTask);
        thread1.start(); // Start the thread, which executes myTask.run()

        // --- Comparison with Lambda Expression (since Java 8) ---
        // For functional interfaces like Runnable, lambdas offer a more concise syntax:
        Runnable myLambdaTask = () -> {
            System.out.println("Lambda: Task running in another new thread.");
            try {
                Thread.sleep(500); // Simulate some work
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                System.err.println("Lambda thread interrupted!");
            }
            System.out.println("Lambda: Task finished.");
        };

        Thread thread2 = new Thread(myLambdaTask);
        thread2.start();

        System.out.println("Main thread continues execution...");
    }
}
```

#### Output (will vary slightly due to thread scheduling):

Main thread started.<br>
Main thread continues execution...<br>
Anonymous class: Task running in a new thread.<br>
Lambda: Task running in another new thread.<br>
Lambda: Task finished.<br>
Anonymous class: Task finished.<br>

In the example, instead of creating a separate class file (e.g., MyRunnableClass.java) just to implement Runnable once, we define its implementation directly inline where the object is created. While lambdas are now preferred for single-abstract-method interfaces, understanding anonymous classes is crucial for grasping Java's evolution and for working with older codebases or more complex inline class definitions.

### Let's look at a very simple example of an anonymous class using a Runnable interface, which is a common use case. <br>

Imagine you want to define a simple task that a thread can run, but you only need this specific task once. <br>

```Java

public class SimpleAnonymousClassExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        System.out.println("Main thread is starting.");

        // Here's the anonymous class!
        // We're creating an object that implements the 'Runnable' interface
        // right here, without giving it a formal class name.
        Runnable myOneTimeTask = new Runnable() {
            @Override // We must implement the 'run()' method of the Runnable interface
            public void run() {
                System.out.println("This message is from the anonymous task.");
                // You could put any code here for this one-time task
            }
        };

        // Now, we create a new Thread and tell it to run our anonymous task
        Thread thread = new Thread(myOneTimeTask);
        thread.start(); // This executes the run() method of our anonymous class

        System.out.println("Main thread has finished setting up the task.");
    }
}
```

### How it works:

new Runnable() { ... }; is the core of the anonymous class. It's saying: "Create a new object that implements Runnable, and its implementation of the run() method is everything inside these curly braces {...}." <br> <br>
Notice there's no class name after new (like new MyRunnableClass()). That's what makes it anonymous!
It's a single, self-contained unit of code that's used immediately. <br> <br>
When you run this, you'll likely see output similar to this (the order of "Main thread" and "Anonymous task" messages might vary slightly due to thread scheduling): <br> <br>

Main thread is starting. <br>
Main thread has finished setting up the task. <br>
This message is from the anonymous task. <br> <br>
This example clearly shows how you can define a specific behavior (the run() method) for an interface (or an abstract class) right where you need it, without the overhead of creating a separate, named .java file.

# Anonymous Objects in Java

An anonymous object in Java is an object that is created without being assigned to a named reference variable. It is instantiated directly and used immediately, typically in a single line of code.<br><br>

Think of it as a temporary, "throwaway" object.

#### Example of an Anonymous Object:

```Java

class MessagePrinter {
    public void printMessage(String msg) {
        System.out.println("Message: " + msg);
    }

    public int calculateSum(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}

public class AnonymousObjectExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        System.out.println("--- Using an anonymous object ---");

        // Creating an anonymous object of MessagePrinter and immediately calling its method
        new MessagePrinter().printMessage("Hello from an anonymous object!");

        // Another example: using an anonymous object to get a return value directly
        int sum = new MessagePrinter().calculateSum(10, 20);
        System.out.println("Calculated sum using anonymous object: " + sum);

        System.out.println("\n--- Comparison with a named object ---");

        // This is how you'd normally do it (using a named reference variable)
        MessagePrinter namedPrinter = new MessagePrinter(); // 'namedPrinter' is the reference variable
        namedPrinter.printMessage("Hello from a named object!");
        int namedSum = namedPrinter.calculateSum(5, 7);
        System.out.println("Calculated sum using named object: " + namedSum);

        // You can reuse 'namedPrinter' later
        namedPrinter.printMessage("This message is also from the named object.");
    }
}
```

#### Output:

--- Using an anonymous object ---
Message: Hello from an anonymous object! <br>
Calculated sum using anonymous object: 30<br>

--- Comparison with a named object ---<br>
Message: Hello from a named object!<br>
Calculated sum using named object: 12<br>
This message is also from the named object.<br>

## Purpose of Anonymous Objects:

### Anonymous objects are useful in situations where:

#### One-Time Use:

You need to create an object solely to call one of its methods, and you won't need to refer to that object again. This saves you the step of declaring and assigning it to a named variable.

#### Method Chaining / Fluent APIs:

They fit well into fluent API designs where a method call returns an object instance, allowing you to chain subsequent method calls directly.

```Java
// Conceptual example of method chaining with anonymous objects
// new StringBuilder().append("Hello").append(" World").toString();
```

### Passing as Arguments:

You might create an anonymous object directly as an argument to a method that expects an object of a certain type.

```Java
// Assuming a method like: void process(MyConfig config)
// process(new MyConfig(true, "debug")); // MyConfig object created anonymously
```

### Reducing Verbosity:

For very simple, immediate operations, they can make the code slightly more concise by eliminating the variable declaration.

### Key Distinction:

Anonymous Object vs. Anonymous Class
It's important to differentiate:

### Anonymous Class:

This refers to the class definition itself that has no name. It's a class created inline to implement an interface or extend a class for a single-use class definition. An anonymous class always results in an anonymous object.

### Anonymous Object:

This simply refers to an object instance that is created without being assigned to a variable. It can be an instance of a regular, named class (like new MessagePrinter() in the example above) or an instance of an anonymous class.

### In short:

An anonymous object is an object without a name/reference. An anonymous class is a class definition without a name. An anonymous class produces an anonymous object.
